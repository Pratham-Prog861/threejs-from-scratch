# 🚀 Three.js From Scratch

Hey there, future 3D web developer! Welcome to **Three.js From Scratch** - your complete journey from zero to hero in creating stunning 3D experiences on the web. 🎨✨

If you've ever wondered how those amazing 3D websites are built, or wanted to create interactive 3D graphics, games, or visualizations in the browser - you're in the right place!

## 🎯 What is This Repository?

This is a **hands-on, project-based learning path** for mastering Three.js. Each folder contains a complete project with:

- ✅ Working code examples
- ✅ Detailed README with explanations
- ✅ Challenges to test your understanding
- ✅ Links to official docs and resources

Think of this as your **30-day Three.js challenge** (or go at your own pace!). Each project builds on the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts and techniques.

## 🎓 Who Is This For?

This course is perfect for you if:

- ✅ You know **basic JavaScript** (variables, functions, loops)
- ✅ You're comfortable with **HTML & CSS**
- ✅ You want to learn **3D web development**
- ✅ You love **hands-on, project-based learning**

**No prior 3D experience needed!** We'll start from the absolute basics.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- A **code editor** (VS Code recommended)
- A **modern browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratham-prog861/threejs-from-scratch.git
   cd threejs-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Navigate to any project**

   ```bash
   cd 01-basics/01-first-scene
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### The Learning Flow

1. **Start with 01-basics/01-first-scene** - Don't skip ahead!
2. **Read the README** in each project folder
3. **Study the code** - Try to understand every line
4. **Run the project** - See it in action
5. **Complete the challenges** - This is where real learning happens
6. **Experiment** - Break things, fix them, make it your own
7. **Move to the next project** when you feel confident

### Tips for Success

💡 **Code along** - Don't just read, type the code yourself  
💡 **Take breaks** - 3D concepts can be mind-bending at first  
💡 **Use the docs** - Get comfortable with the [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)  
💡 **Join the community** - Ask questions, share your work  
💡 **Build your own projects** - Apply what you learn to your ideas

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - The 3D library we're learning
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Fast development server and build tool
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, just pure JS
- **WebGL** - The underlying technology (Three.js handles this for us!)
